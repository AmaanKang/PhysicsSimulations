        <h1>Projectile Motion Simulation</h1>
        <p>Projectile motion refers to the motion of an object that is thrown or projected into the air. The motion is dependent on the gravity and air resistance.
           Thus, a projectile will fllow a different motion if any of these factors change - Speed of throw, Angle of throw, Gravity in that place and the air resistance.
            This simulation will help understand how the motion of a projectile changes with the change in speed and angle of throw. You can control these two factors
            easily but the gravity and air resistance are controlled by environment, hence these cannot be easily controlled.
